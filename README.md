# TurbulenceResearch
This repository contains my ongoing research work under Dr. Mohapatra, focused on simulating astrophysical fluid dynamics and turbulence. I am currently working with Rayleigh and Kevin Holtz simulation frameworks to model convective processes and analyze the stability and evolution of stellar interiors. As the project progresses, I am gradually transitioning to Athena++, a high-performance astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code, to enable more complex and scalable simulations. This repository will document my workflow, scripts, and analysis tools developed throughout this transition, emphasizing reproducibility and computational efficiency in stellar and galactic modeling.
